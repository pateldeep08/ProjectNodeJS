## Difficulties for the DevOps part 

* I have an error that I can't fix. I have pass couple of hour but no solution. 
>ObjectParameterError: Parameter "obj" to Document() must be an object, got pirre
So I connot move forward on the test side 

* I got some difficulties for the ports, which port to connect where. But problem solve

## In order to grade easily the NodeJS project this is what the app do and not do : 
* Create an user password should be more than 6 digits 
* all the fields should be fill
* no two time same email 
* Login 
* There are no flash messages on error. 
* The user part and metric part are independante. No possibility for an user to save his own metric 
* Lagout button is working 
* We can add a metric which will be add on the Aray and the graph dynamically 
* Button Delete don't work
